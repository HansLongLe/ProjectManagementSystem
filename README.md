## About The Project


There are about 45508 companies listed in stock exchanges around the world
(Prahbu, n.d.). Today’s consumerism society requires these companies not only to
serve the customer appropriately, but also to do many other “background” actions,
such as: storing the data that the users input, sorting documents in files or databases,
improving their products, etc. (Doddi, n.d.). Therefore, there have been made countless
software products, that simplify the tasks companies need to make. Although these
software systems might be helpful, they lack in different aspects, such as incorrect data
edits, incorrect coding/implementation of business rules, difficulty in understanding or
usage, and so on. (Rice, n.d.) Even though some companies decide to bear with the
inconveniences, others may decide to build their own software systems.

Color-IT company is a small company that deals with private customers. This
company is working in IT domain and creates programs for customers. Currently,
Color-IT does not have a project management system, which is an inconvenience for
them. Usually, their customers have no programming skills. Instead, they are
accustomed with system domain and sometimes have an idea about future systems.
When dealing with customers, the Color-IT company formulate a list of requirements in
form of user stories.

The purpose is to create a Project Management System that is going to
organize data about workers and projects’ information. The system is going to have
different actions (deleting and adding requirements, assign requirements to workers,
change status of the projects, etc.) for managing the data and will have different actors
with different functions (project creator, scrum master, members of the group) to use
these actions.
